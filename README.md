# PyXlinkViewer
This repository contains the installation zip file, user manual and source code for the PyXlinkViewer plugin for PyMOL v2. 

PyXlinkViewer is a cross-platform plugin for the widely used PyMOL molecular graphics system designed to enable rapid visualisation of protein crosslinking-mass spectrometry (XL-MS) data. PyXlinkViewer maps inter- and intra-protein crosslinks (and monolinks) onto high-resolution structures and models, and automates the calculation of inter-residue distances for the detected crosslinks. This enables rapid visualisation of XL-MS data, assessment of whether a set of detected crosslinks is congruent with structural data, and easy production of high-quality images for publication. Please see the user manual for a detailed description of how to install and use the plugin.
